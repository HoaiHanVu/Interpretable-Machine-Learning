# Interpretable Machine Learning 

## Introduction

This repository focuses on enhancing the interpretability of complex machine learning models. We aim to provide explanations for model behavior and individual predictions to improve transparency and understanding. By leveraging advanced methods such as the Lime package, SHAP frameworks, and Perturbation Importance Features, we explore and synthesize techniques for interpreting ML models and their practical applications.
This works assist understanding and interpreting complex machine learning models using the Lime package, SHAP frameworks, and Perturbation Importance Features. The insights gained from this repository can be applied to improve the transparency and interpretability of ML models in various practical applications.


## Features

- `Lime Package`: The repository includes the implementation of the Lime package, which allows us to generate local explanations for individual predictions by approximating the model's decision boundaries.
- `SHAP Frameworks`: We leverage the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) frameworks to compute the contribution of each feature to a model's prediction, providing global explanations for the model's behavior.
- `Perturbation Importance Features`: We employ perturbation techniques to analyze the importance of features by measuring the impact of feature perturbations on the model's predictions, facilitating interpretability.
